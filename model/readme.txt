Fine-tuned ICAE based on Llama-2-7b-chat.

The weights of the original Llama-2-7b-chat are set to 0 because we don't have the right to distribute the Llama-2-7b-chat model's weights. If you have access to Llama-2-7b-chat, you can recover these weights from your accessible Llama-2-7b-chat checkpoint.
